## Project Overview

Im using data that simulate Amazon Prime customer data of the year 2024 to analyze the customers and to get come up with useful insights for the decisions of the company such as Customer Churn Rate and Retention rate.

## Data Source

Kaggle: [Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arnavsmayan/amazon-prime-userbase-dataset/data)

## Tools

-- MS SQL Server/ SQL Server Management Studio for data manipulation and calculations to be later used for answering important questions and to visualise them.
-- Tableau Public used for the visualisations and the creation of the dashboard

## Goal

Goal is to answer important questions for the company and to provide insights. Such questions are: 
-- What are the Customer Churn and Retention Rates for the quarters of the year 2024?
-- How many new customer subscription the company got and how many subscriptions were cancelled in 2024
-- Basic statistical insights such as percentages of the popularity of each Subscription Plan


## Data Preparation 

--There wasn't much needed as there were no duplicates or problematic data but i did check just in case using Excel. 

## Calculations 

--The calculations were made in Ms Sql Server to simulate a usage of huge dataset so SQL would be a preferred way of working for optimizing performance. Most of the calculations were done here and you can find the Querry file here [Click Here](https://github.com/Kobu47/Amazon-Prime-Customer-Analysis-Simulation/blob/main/Amazon_Prime_Data_Analysis_Query.sql). Since i used Tableau Public for the visualisation i couldn't connect to the SQL server directly so i just saved the results to these exact CSV files :
